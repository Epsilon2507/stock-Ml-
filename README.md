ðŸ“ˆ Stock Trading Strategy Using Machine Learning ðŸ¤–
Project Overview
This project aims to help investors make informed decisions on when to buy and sell stocks using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical stock data, we predict optimal buy and sell points, providing actionable insights for better investment strategies.

Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Extract and clean historical stock data, and engineer relevant features.
Model Training: Implement and fine-tune various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and LSTM for accurate predictions.
Evaluation & Validation: Use techniques like cross-validation and backtesting to ensure model robustness.
Visualization: Create intuitive graphs to show buy/sell signals and overall stock performance.
Tools and Libraries
Python: The core programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data cleaning and preparation.
NumPy: To handle numerical operations efficiently.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Keras/TensorFlow: For deep learning and neural network implementation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: To visualize stock trends and model performance.
